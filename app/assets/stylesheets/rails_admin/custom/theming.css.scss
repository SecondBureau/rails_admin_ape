  Customize RailsAdmin theme here.
  Copy this file to your app/assets/rails_admin/custom/theming.css.scss, leave this one untouched
  Don't require it in your application.rb

  Look at the markup in RailsAdmin and go there to get inspiration from:
    http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

  Test me: (actual color should be the one defined in variables.css.scss if you did)
    body{ background-color: $linkColor; }
